Break screen channels for displaying and reacting to donations and donation totals during mainline Games Done Quick and Frame Fatales broadcasts.

It is recommended to use `corepack` if it's available in your Node.js installation.

- Check if it is available with `corepack --version`
- Enable it with `corepack enable npm yarn pnpm`.

## Requirements

- Node v14
- npm@6.x.x

While other Node versions may work for this project, we use and deploy against Node v14 due to some dependencies of our current layout system (Pratchett).
